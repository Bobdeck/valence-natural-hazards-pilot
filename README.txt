VALENCE | SURF LIFE SAVING NATURAL HAZARDS PILOT
Dashboard v0.2 | two-site Bay of Plenty pilot | checked 18 September 2026 NZST

HOSTED TEST INSTANCE
The stabilised Dashboard v0.2 source is ready for the dedicated Valence Vercel test project valence-natural-hazards-pilot. The live HTTPS URL is pending connection of the Valence Vercel account. Once deployed, the HTTPS dashboard is the review environment and Open_Map.cmd is not required. The launcher remains a local fallback only.

OPEN THE DASHBOARD
1. Run Open_Map.cmd.
2. Leave the CMD window open.
3. The browser opens the dashboard.
4. Close the CMD window when finished.

Opening index.html directly as a file pauses online basemap tiles and shows a concise launch instruction. Open_Map.cmd selects an available loopback-only port so the Map and Aerial basemaps can load normally with compliant web requests.

PILOT SITES

Use the left sidebar to switch clubs. The selected marker, site summary, hazard cards, evidence detail and map view update together. Each club retains a separate evidence record.

BASEMAPS AND OVERLAYS
- Map uses the policy-compliant OpenStreetMap Standard URL https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png with visible © OpenStreetMap contributors attribution.
- Aerial uses Esri World Imagery with visible Esri and source attribution.
- Council hazard overlays are independent of the selected basemap. Changing Map or Aerial does not switch hazard layers off.
- Leaflet 1.9.4 CSS, JavaScript and marker assets are bundled inside index.html.

EVIDENCE RULES
- Results are original source observations, not professional risk ratings.
- No point hit, NoData and missing sources remain unassessed and never become green.
- Lee's company will define configurable thresholds, consequences, rating methods and approvals.
- Property and lease boundaries remain outside this iteration.
- Public GIS access does not itself confirm commercial redistribution rights. Retain attribution and confirm council/GNS rights before reproducing source geometry in a client-facing product.
